## Near-ish future

- [ ] support Joi.any & Joi.alternatives in joi2graphql for prettier-git-hook.mdx
- [ ] Make a proper "Config" provider to add recipes dir, store data, etc.
- [ ] init.js for providers to setup clients
- [ ] validate resource config
- [ ] Theme UI preset selection (runs dependent install and file write)
- [ ] Failing postinstall scripts cause client to hang
- [ ] Select input supported recipes
- [ ] Refactor resource state to use Redux & record runs in local db
- [ ] move creating the validate function to core and out of resources â€” they just declare their schema
- [ ] get latest version of npm packages so know if can skip running.
- [ ] Make `dependencyType` in NPMPackage an enum (joi2gql doesn't handle this right now from Joi enums)
- [ ] Show in plan if an update will be applied vs. create.
- [ ] Implement config object for GatsbyPlugin
- [ ] Handle JS in config objects? { **\_javascript: "`\${**dirname}/foo/bar`" }
- [ ] handle people pressing Y & quit if they press "n" (for now)
- [ ] Automatically create list of recipes from the recipes directory (recipes resource ðŸ¤”)
- [ ] ShadowFile needs more validation â€” validate the file to shadow exists.
- [ ] Add eslint support & add Typescript eslint plugins to the typescript recipe.
- [ ] add recipe mdx-pages once we can write out options https://gist.github.com/KyleAMathews/3d763491e5c4c6396e1a6a626b2793ce
- [ ] Add PWA recipe once we can write options https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gillkyle/9e4fa3d019c525aef2f4bd431c806879/raw/f4d42a81190d2cada59688e6acddc6b5e97fe586/make-your-site-a-pwa.mdx
