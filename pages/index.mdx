## FAQ

<Callout sx={{ mx: [null, null, -3, -4] }}>
<FAQ>

- **What is a hackathon? üß≥**
  A hackathon is a competition in which participants build a software and/or hardware project in a fixed amount of time. Typically participants compete in small teams or individually.

- **What is this hackathon all about?**
  This hackathon exists to give you and other OSU students & alumni the opportunity to build a project over a weekend and compete for prizes. It is meant to be low-pressure, inclusive of everybody, and fun! In this hackathon, you are not required or encouraged to forego sleep, work, time with your family, or etc to participate. You are encouraged to make the best product you can in the time alotted. You are encouraged to learn and add skills to your repetoire. And you are encouraged to have a good time doing it! 

- **How much does it cost? üí∏**
  Totally free! Just your time and energy and creativity!

- **Who can participate? üî≠**
  Any OSU student or alumni (this includes undergraduate, graduate, post-bacc, on-campus, ecampus students)

- **What can I make? ü§ñ**
  Anything you can think of! Web apps, mobile apps, websites, slackbots, APIs, command-line programs, games, robots, anything!

- **I am new to coding. Can/Should I still participate? üëæ**
  In short, YES! No prior experience is necessary to compete in this event. In fact, there is a separate prize for teams of entirely new students to compete for. This event is a great time to learn a new technology or practice one you already know while simultaneously building a project you can showcase on your resume!  

- **How many people to a team? üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß**
  Teams of up to 4 people! 

- **How do we form teams? ü§ù**
  You can choose to form your own teams (feel free to post under *#teams* on Slack if you're looking for teammates), or have us assign you a team (based on classes taken, timezone, programming languages, etc.). If you want to form your own team, select "No" under the Free Agent section of Registration. All Free Agents will be assigned a team. 

- **What are Free Agents? ü§î**
  Free Agents are people looking to be placed on a team. If you want us to assign you to a team, please select "Yes" under the Free Agent section of Registration. After registration closes, and before we place you on a team, we will send an email confirming your participation in BeaverHacks (just in case something has come up and you can no longer participate). Please respond ASAP so we can form teams accordingly! üôè

- ** Have more questions? Check out the FAQ Doc üìù**
  [BeaverHacks FAQ Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwDWXQ3hHkpx30ReBKlzHvsPYN3VGrLDK3KxVRX3AGM/edit?usp=sharing). It has info on all of the BeaverHacks deliverables (e.g. project proposals, submissions, demos, and more) and deadlines!
