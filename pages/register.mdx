      - If you signed up to be a **Free Agent** (which means that you want to be placed onto a team):
        - **You must reply to the confirmation email by no later than the Team Formation Deadline (TBD)**
        - **Even if you can no longer participate (or have found a team already), please reply back to the email. This will help us know who is still available to be placed on teams. Thank you!**
      - All teams (even teams of 1) must fill out a Team Form. If you have been placed onto a team, your team must still fill out a Team Form.
