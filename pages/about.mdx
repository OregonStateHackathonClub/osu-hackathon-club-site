# Mission Statement

Our mission is to strengthen the OSU community by fostering connections between students and building stronger programming skills through quarterly coding competitions and workshops.

# Our Start

Because the **OSU Hackathon Club** was originally created with the needs of Ecampus CS students in mind, our monthly meetings, weekly HackerWeeks competitions, and quarterly BeaverHacks hackathons are held **entirely online**.

Through small, humble beginnings our club has continued to grow through the support of OSU students, alumni and faculty. **We welcome tech enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels, experiences, and majors!**
